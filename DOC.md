## Recent Updates & Implementations

### Mother Application Form
1. Made the form fully dynamic with conditional rendering based on applicant type:

2. Database Integration:
   - Implemented data insertion into `mother_applications` table
   - Created comprehensive database schema with all required fields
   - Added proper validation for all form inputs

### Data Flow & Relationships
1. Established dynamic linking between Mother and Sub-applications:
   - Mother application ID is now automatically linked to sub-applications
   - Sub-application form can fetch related mother application details

### Dynamic Tables & Data Display
1. Implemented dynamic table views:
   - Mother applications table now fetches and displays data from database
   - Added sorting and filtering capabilities

### Current Work in Progress
- Working on complex business logic between mother and sub-applications
- Implementing validation rules and data consistency checks
- Building relationship handlers between applications

### Technical Challenges
- The integration of business logic between applications is taking longer than anticipated due to complexity
- Need to ensure data integrity across related applications

### Next Steps
1. Complete the business logic implementation
2. Add error handling and validation messages
3. Implement user feedback mechanisms
4. Add data export capabilities

### Note to Team
If there are any urgent tasks that need prioritization, please let me know. Currently focused on the application relationship handlers, but can adjust priorities as needed.
